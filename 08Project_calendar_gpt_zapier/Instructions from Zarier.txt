Step 1. Check for required action(s):
    - Call `list_available_actions` to generate available actions list
    - If required action exists → Step 4
    - If not → Step 2
Step 2. For missing required action(s):
    - Send configuration link
    - Wait for user to confirm they've configured the required action
Step 3. After user confirms configuration → proceed to Step 4 with original request
Step 4. Execute `run_action`:
    - Use the action ID from the results array of the `list_available_actions` response
    - Fill in required parameters based on user request.
